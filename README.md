# IA-306-Deep-Learning
Repository for my work over the 3rd year course IA-306 (now CSC_5AI06_TP) - Deep Learning.

## Abstract
Deep Learning (machine learning based on deep artificial neural networks) has become extremely popular over the last years due to the very good results it allows for tasks such as regression, classification or generation.

## Objectives
The objective of this course is to provide a theoretical understanding and a practical usage of the three main types of networks (Multi-Layer- Perceptron, Recurrent-Neural-Network and Convolutional Neural Network). The content of this course ranges from the perceptron to the generation of adversarial images.

At the end of this programme, the student will be able to:
* understand the theory behind the main deep learning architectures
* program these architectures in Python using the most popular deep learning frameworks (pytorch and keras)
* apply them to typical computer vision, NLP or audio problems such as classification, regression or generation.
